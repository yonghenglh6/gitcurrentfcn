Python port of

To use this code:

1. Download and unzip some of the [MILTrack videos](http://vision.ucsd.edu/~bbabenko/project_miltrack.shtml) 
2. Run `./circulant_matrix_tracker.py -i path_to_folder_with_video_data`

Example: `./circulant_matrix_tracker.py -i /path_to_data/surfer/`

During execution drawing is the slowest part, if you close the drawing window, computation will significantly speed-up;
a result curve is show when reaching the end of the video.
